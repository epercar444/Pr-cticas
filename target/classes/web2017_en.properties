servicios.info.covid19.titulo.medidas.descripcion.1=Since the beginning of the healthcare crisis, NACEX has implemented a series of preventative measures in order to guarantee the health and safety of its employees, clients, and collaborators, such as a Contingency Plan to ensure the safety and security of the service, which covers the whole franchise network, head offices and hubs.
servicios.info.covid19.titulo.medidas.descripcion.2=One of the measures that has been implemented to this effect is deliveries by means of "ZERO CONTACT". These deliveries allow the safe distance recommended by the healthcare authorities to be guaranteed. It is no longer necessary for the client to sign for receiving a shipment. Instead, the client receives a QR code, which must be shown to the courier in order to make the delivery.
servicios.info.covid19.titulo.medidas.descripcion.3=In the same vein, in order to guarantee the health and safety of its collaborators and clients, the company is carrying out a disinfection treatment in its hubs, on a fortnightly basis, using the following techniques: spraying floors, walls, toilets, changing rooms, corridors etc. and nebulisation of office areas with the product OX-VIRIN . Furthermore, it ensures that its installations and vehicles are disinfected by means of air purification. In this way, NACEX guarantees the maximum disinfection and adequacy of working facilities.
